## A PROJECT REPORT ON 
>HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
 
## Submitted for 
>DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM LAB

## **Abstract :**

> **“Hospital Database Management System”** is designed to make the existing
  manual system automatic with the help of Computerised equipment and
  full-edged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their
  valuable data and information can be stored for a longer period with easy access
  and manipulation of the same. The required software is easily available and easy
  to work with. This web application can maintain and view computerised records
  without getting redundant entries. The project describes how to manage user
  data for good performance and provide better services for the client.

## **Software Used :**

> The technology selected for implementing Hospital Database Management System is PHP,MYSQL. 
Apache is used as the HTTP server.The Development was done in Visual Studio Code.

**Frontend Technologies :-**

>● **HTML :-** The Hyper Text Markup Language, or HTML is the standard
markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML
documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a
web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of
the document.

>● **CSS :-** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation
of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This
separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
control in the specification of presentation characteristics.

>● **Javascript :-** JavaScript is
a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted
compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language
for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and
many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript is a weakly typed
language (dynamically typed). JavaScript contains a standard library of
objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
like operators, control structures, and statements.

>● **Bootstrap :-** Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS and JavaScript
framework for developing a responsive and mobile friendly website. It is
absolutely free to download and use. It is a front-end framework used for
easier and faster web development. It includes HTML and CSS based
design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals,
image carousels and many others. It can also use JavaScript plug-ins. It
facilitates you to create responsive designs.

**Backend Technologies :-**

> **● PHP :-** PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web
development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer
Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now
produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home
Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext
Preprocessor.

>**● MYSQL :-** MySQL is an open-source relational database management
system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder
Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured
Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more
data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these
relations help structure the data.

## **Conclusion :**

>**This project is built for use in hospital management system for the number of
employees is limited and to maintain patients data efficiently . According to required requirements the admin can view all the details
of the employees .The required records can be easily viewed by the admin anytime he wants
in an instant. The main objective of this framework is to save time, make the system cost effective and management records
efficiently.**
